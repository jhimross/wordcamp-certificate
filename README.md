## Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum Version |
|---|---|
| WordPress | 5.8 |
| PHP | 7.4 |
| Browser | Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) |

> **Note:** The plugin uses `dbDelta()` for table creation and is compatible with both MySQL and SQLite (via the WordPress SQLite Database integration).

---

## Installation

### Option A — Manual Upload

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `wordcamp-certificate` folder into your site's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. In WP Admin, go to **Plugins → Installed Plugins**.
4. Find **WordCamp Certificate Generator** and click **Activate**.

### Option B — Via WP-CLI

```bash
# From your WordPress root
wp plugin install /path/to/wordcamp-certificate --activate
```

### Option C — Clone directly into plugins folder

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wordcamp-certificate.git
wp plugin activate wordcamp-certificate
```

---

## Configuration

After activation, configure the plugin under **WP Admin → WC Certificates → Settings**:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Event Name** | The full name of your WordCamp event | `WordCamp Manila 2025` |
| **Event Date** | Date or date range of the event | `July 12–13, 2025` |
| **Event Location** | City and country (optional) | `Manila, Philippines` |
| **Organizer Name** | Appears on the signature line | `WordCamp Manila Team` |

---

## Usage

### Shortcode

Add this shortcode to any page or post:

```
[wordcamp_certificate]
```

You can also override event details inline:

```
[wordcamp_certificate event_name="WordCamp Manila 2025" event_date="July 12, 2025"]
```

### Gutenberg Block

1. Open the Block Editor on any page or post.
2. Search for **"WordCamp Certificate Form"** in the block inserter.
3. Add the block — it renders a live preview in the editor.
4. Use the **Inspector Controls** (right sidebar) to override the event name and date per-page.

### Direct URL

Once a certificate is generated, it lives at a permanent URL:

```
https://yoursite.com/?wcc_cert=1&token=UNIQUE_TOKEN
```

This URL can be bookmarked, shared, or re-printed at any time.

## 🗄️ Database

On activation the plugin creates one custom table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_wordcamp_certificates (
  id           BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  full_name    VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email        VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  issued_at    DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  cert_token   VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (id),
  UNIQUE KEY   cert_token (cert_token),
  KEY          email (email)
);
```

The table is created with `dbDelta()` so it is safe to re-activate without data loss.

---

## Security

- All AJAX requests are verified with `wp_create_nonce` / `check_ajax_referer`
- User input is sanitized with `sanitize_text_field` and `sanitize_email` before processing or storage
- All database queries use `$wpdb->prepare()` — no raw interpolated SQL
- Certificate tokens are generated with `wp_generate_password( 32, false )` (cryptographically random)
- The certificate template runs outside the WordPress theme loop but does **not** expose any credentials

---

## Customization

### Colors

CSS custom properties are defined at the top of `assets/frontend.css` and inside the `<style>` block of `templates/certificate.php`. Override them in your theme's stylesheet:

```css
/* In your theme's style.css */
.wcc-form-card { --wcc-blue: #your-color; }
```

| Variable | Default | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `--wcc-blue` | `#21759b` | Primary buttons, headings, accents |
| `--wcc-dark` | `#0a2a40` | Dark text, gradient |
| `--wcc-gold` | `#c9a84c` | Corner ornaments, dividers |
| `--wcc-light` | `#f0f7fb` | Form header background tint |
| `--wcc-border` | `#d4e8f3` | Input and card borders |

### Fonts

The certificate uses **Playfair Display** (Google Fonts) for headings and **Inter** for body text. To use custom fonts, edit the `<link>` tag at the top of `templates/certificate.php`.

### Certificate Logo

The WordPress "W" SVG logo in `templates/certificate.php` can be swapped for your own event logo by replacing the `<svg>` inside `.wc-logo`.

---

## Hooks & Filters

The plugin is built to be extendable. Future versions will expose the following hooks (contributions welcome):

| Hook | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `wcc_before_certificate_insert` | action | Fires before a new certificate record is saved |
| `wcc_after_certificate_insert` | action | Fires after a new certificate record is saved |
| `wcc_certificate_data` | filter | Filter the data array before it is passed to the certificate template |
| `wcc_form_fields` | filter | Add or remove fields from the attendee form |
